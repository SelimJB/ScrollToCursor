# ScrollToCursor

ScrollToCursor is a Sublime Text plugin that centers the view on the cursor's last position from the previous session upon file opening or view activation. If no cursor is detected, it offers configurable settings to either scroll to the top or maintain the current view. All this to facilitate a smoother and more efficient resumption of work in lengthy documents.
